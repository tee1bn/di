                    <p style="text-align: justify"><?=project_name;?> is a community of people providing each other financial help on the principle of gratuitousness, reciprocity and benevolence. In <?=project_name;?> you don’t have to make contracts or pledge your property. In <?=project_name;?> there are no lenders and no debtors. Everything is very simple: one participant asks for help — another one helps. The only thing that <?=project_name;?> demands from its participants is to be honest and kind to each other. You ask for financial help when you need it, you give financial help when you are able to do it.<br><br>

In <?=project_name;?> there is no central account where all the money in the system flows to (and where it can be easily stolen from). All the money is in the bank accounts belonging to the members only! The members transfer funds to each other directly, without intermediaries! In fact, <?=project_name;?> only regulates the process and nothing else. So the entire system belongs to people. No kidding! It is a real mutual aid fund where ordinary people help each other.<br><br>

<strong>How does it work technically?</strong> You declare your willingness to provide help (click “Provide Help” in your Personal Office (hereinafter PO), after which your account is rewarded with an amount in Mavro (internal "currency"/scores in the system). Once another participant confirms the receipt of the money from you (your PH-request gets the status “Confirmed”), Mavro start growing at the monthly rate of 30-50%. Growth stops at exactly one month for Mavro 30% and three months for Mavro 40% or Mavro 50%. The amount in Mavro increases every day from the moment that you make a request to provide help. Say you have announced willingness to assist someone with 10,000 dollars you are rewarded with Mavro-30% in your PO. After the request is made your Mavro immediately start growing! 30 days later, 10,000 becomes 13,000 Mavro. Accordingly, you will be able to request help worth of 13,000 dollars after providing help again equal to or higher than the previous help provided and paying 10% of the new contribution. You receive an order for providing help (PH order) in your Personal Office. If you do not complete it within 48 hours, you are removed from the system. (For all eternity.)
However, if you do not provide help within 48hrs after you have been matched or your contribution is not confirmed within 48hrs of payment, additional time may be added subject to the receiver’s consent.

Should you have any questions regarding the topic, our online consultants are willing to help and answer all of your questions.<br><br>

Please note that the use of the words 30% a month cannot be considered as a yield or interest rate since the funds are given away; we are not earning anything (we are a mutual-aid fund), and nobody promises or guarantees to pay it! Read over <strong>THE WARNING.</strong></p><br><br>

<h4>TYPES OF MAVRO</h4>
<ul class="ordered-list" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 150px !important">
<li><strong>Standard 30% contribution.</strong><br>
<i>The growth rate is 30% in 30 days. You can create a GH request 30 days after you provided help and all the recipients confirmed getting help from you.</i></li><br>
<li><strong>Crypto 50% contribution.</strong><br>
<i>The growth rate is 50% in 30 days on cryptocurrency PH. You can create a GH request 30 days after you provided help and all the recipients confirmed getting help from you.</i></li><br>
<li><strong>Three-month 40% contribution(Standard).</strong><br>
<i>The growth rate is 40% per month. In the event of an early withdrawal of funds, the total amount will be recalculated at the rate of 30% per month.
For example, you provided help in the amount of 1000 USD.
In 3 months, you can withdraw 1000 + 400 + 400 + 400 = 2,200 ( in other words, the growth on your PH will be 40% a month.)
However, if you decide to withdraw your funds earlier, for example in 2 months, the return on your PH will be recalculated and it will make up 30% per month, so you will get: 1000 + 300 + 300 = 1600</i></li><br>
<li><strong>Bonus withdrawal 30% contribution.</strong><br>
<i>The growth rate is 30% per month. This PH is matched within 48hrs and is supposed to be made to withdraw bonuses (Referral, guider’s, video testimonial or leadership bonus) You can create a GH request of 2 times the amount of help you provided from your bonuses after confirmation of this contribution.</i></li><br>
<li><strong>Recommitment 30% contribution.</strong><br>
<i>The growth rate is 30% per month. 10% of this PH is matched within 12hrs and is supposed to be made to withdraw standard 30% contribution You can create a GH request 30 days after you provided help and all the recipients confirmed getting help from you.</i></li><br>
<li><strong>Crypto Recommitment 50% contribution.</strong><br>
<i>The growth rate is 50% per month on cryptocurrency PH. 20% of this PH is matched within 12hrs and is supposed to be made to withdraw standard 40% contribution You can create a GH request 30 days after you provided help and all the recipients confirmed getting help from you.</i></li>
</ul> <br>
<p style="text-align: justify">Three-month contributions are expected to work like a shock absorber when panics occur. If participants acquire and hold their Mavro for a long time, they will think hard whether to withdraw them earlier or not (as they can lose their extra bonuses).</p><br>

<h4>REGISTRATION BONUS</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">When registering in the system, you get from $20 to $100 as a present.<br>
But not everyone, only those who have contributed their own money as well. (Otherwise the System will be pulled apart. For bonuses. They will keep registering endlessly. :-))</p>

                    <ul class="ordered-list" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 150px !important">
<li><b>$20</b> — if you have contributed from $50 to $499. Awarded after withdrawal of your first contribution and withdrawable 60 days after your first contribution. If your account is blocked within this period you will lose your bonus.</li>
<li><b>$50</b> — if you have contributed from $500 to $2,999. Awarded after withdrawal of your first contribution and withdrawable 60 days after your first contribution. If your account is blocked within this period you will lose your bonus.</li>
<li><b>$100</b> — if you have contributed $3,000 and above. Also Awarded after withdrawal of your first contribution and withdrawable 60 days after your first contribution. If your account is blocked within this period you will lose your bonus.</li>
                    </ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">Once again about “freezing”. Bear in mind that if you cancel your contribution or fail to provide help you will lose all your registration bonuses</p><br>




<h4>REFERRAL BONUS</h4>
 
<p style="text-align: justify">Participants are credited with a Referral Bonus of +10% from the amount of the contribution made by each new member (referral) you invited to the System. Bonuses are credited in Mavro 30% which may be taken out as soon as the referral has provided help and got his Mavro confirmed. You can invite a participant through a referral link or <?=project_name;?> invite (email) or username. You will get the bonus from each referral’s new contribution, but only for "new" money.<br><br>

For example, if he provides help of $1000, you will get 100-dollar bonus. If after that the participant takes out $1500 and then provided help of $2000, the bonus will be credited only for input/output difference i.e. for $1500 (1000-1500+2000=1500). In total the bonus will make up $150, but not $200. Note that this bonus is subsequently calculated as (Highest PH - Highest GH + New PH) x 10% <br><br>

<b>ATTENTION!</b> You don't have to invite new people to the system! Should you invite anyone? That's good, you will get even a referral bonus for that. If you do not? It is OK. You are free to participate without attracting new members.</p><br><br>

<h4>GUIDER’S BONUS</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">Guiders of <?=project_name;?> Community can create their own multi-level structures and get a bonus from each donation of every participant in their structures. This is a multi-level bonus, thus a guider can have his own leader whose rank is higher. Guider’s bonus depends on his level in the Community:<br>
For example, if you are Ronald’s guider, Ronald is Maricel’s guider and Maricel is Joseph’s, you will get 2% from Ronald’s donation, 3.5% from Maricel’s donation and 2.5% from Joseph’s. If someone will be under Joseph, you will get from him 1% and so on.<br>
Guider’s bonuses are credited in the same way as referral, but only from new money deposited and will be available to withdraw after confirmation of your help provided and providing bonus withdrawal contribution, you can only withdraw twice the amount of help you provided. This is done to sustain the community.<br><br>
Guider’s Bonus structure:<br>
1st Level - 2.5%<br>
2nd Level - 3.5%<br>
3rd Level -  2%<br>
4th &amp; 5th Level - 1%<br>
</p>

<h4>FROZEN MAVRO WITHDRAWAL</h4>
 
<p style="text-align: justify">Participants get a defrost of +10% of their frozen Mavro in MMM from the amount of the contribution they make to the community.<br>
Defrost is released 12hrs after contribution Mavro is confirmed. You will get the defrost from each new contribution, but only for "new" money.<br>
For example, if you provide help of $1000, you will get 100-dollar defrost. If after that you take out $1500 and then provided help of $2000, the defrost will be credited only for input/output difference i.e. for $1500 (1000-1500+2000=1500). In total the defrost will make up $150, but not $200. Note that this defrost is subsequently calculated as (Highest PH - highest GH + New PH) x 10%</p>
 
<h4>BONUS FOR THE VIDEO IN THE TESTIMONIALS</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">Bonus for the video in a "Letter of happiness" is +10%, +5% or +1% of the amount of received help.<br>

After receiving help you have to send a "Letter of happiness". If you attach a video to it, you will get a bonus. The bonus is credited for each "Letter of happiness".<br><br>

<h4 style="text-transform: capitalize;">WHAT IS BITCOIN AND HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN <?=project_name;?> USING BITCOINS?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and worldwide payment system. It is the first decentralized digital currency, as the system works without a central bank or single administrator. (Wikipedia) It's more profitable, faster, and safer to provide help using bitcoins rather than traditional currencies.<br><br>
