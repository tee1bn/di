<?=project_name;?> is a community of people providing each other financial help on the principle of gratuitousness, reciprocity and benevolence. In <?=project_name;?> you don’t have to make contracts or pledge your property. In <?=project_name;?> there are no lenders and no debtors. Everything is very simple: one participant asks for help — another one helps. The only thing that <?=project_name;?> demands from its participants is to be honest and kind to each other. You ask for financial help when you need it, you give financial help when you are able to do it. 


                        <br><br>

                        In <?=project_name;?> there is no central account where all the money in the system flows to (and where it can be easily stolen from). All the money is in the bank accounts belonging to the members only! The members transfer funds to each other directly, without intermediaries! In fact, <?=project_name;?> only regulates the process and nothing else. So the entire system belongs to the participants. No kidding! It is a real mutual aid fund where ordinary people help each other.<br><br>

<strong>How does it work technically?</strong> You declare your willingness to provide help 
(PH) (click “Provide Help” in your Dashboard and input the amount you want to PH after which you will be matched with another participant who wants help. Once the other participant confirms the receipt of the money from you (your PH-request gets the status “Confirmed”), Mavro start growing at the rate of 50%. Growth stops at exactly 14 days. The amount in Mavro increases as soon as a PH is 100% complete. However, if you do not complete your PH within 48hrs after you have been matched or your contribution is not confirmed within 48hrs of payment, the match will be cancelled automatically, the help Provider will be blocked from the system while the Help Receiver will be rematched to another participant.  Should you have any questions regarding the topic, our 24hrs online consultants are willing to help and answer all of your questions.
<br><br>

Please note that the use of the words 50% in 14 days cannot be considered as a yield or interest rate since the funds are given away; we are not earning anything (we are a mutual-aid fund), and nobody promises or guarantees to pay it! Read over <b>THE WARNING</b>.<br><br>

<h4>COMMITTMENT POLICY</h4>
<ul class="ordered-list" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 150px !important">
<li>Kindly note that to foster commitment, 20% of the Help pledge is matched instantly as down payment. Remaining pledges will be matched later.</li>
<br>

<li>The sustainability of the platform is built on commitment of its members. Every member must Provide Help (PH) not less than 100% of their last PH. You can provide more!.</li><br>

<li> A Get help (GH) request will only be granted when the participant recommits 100% or more of their last PH and pays the 20% down payment.</li><br>

</ul> 


<h4>REFERRAL BONUS</h4>
 
<p style="text-align: justify">
Participants are credited with a Referral Bonus of 5% from the amount of contribution made by each new member (referral) you invite to the System. Referral bonuses are credited in Mavro which may be taken out as soon as the referral’s PH has been confirmed. You can invite a participant by giving your <?=project_name;?> username to them.
<br><br>

<b>ATTENTION!</b> 
 You don't have to invite new people to the system! Should you invite anyone? That's good for the smooth running and health of the system, if you do not? It is OK. You are free to participate without attracting new members.
